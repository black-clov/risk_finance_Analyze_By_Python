  * Performs complete comparisons of competitive strategy, financial strength, growth potential, and valuation of two companies through fundamental and technical analysis.
  * Wrote data parser and reader to download 10-Q and 10-K SEC filings and store them in pandas DataFrame, as well as scripts to append certain business performance metrics for trend analysis.
  * Designed risk-analysis models using Monte-Carlo Simulations and implemented visualizations using matplotlib and Seaborn.
  * Combined data with experts' opinions and shareholder sentiment on business strategy and comapny/management direction to make final "better buy" decision.

[Risk/Return Analysis and Predictions for 'FAANG' Stocks](https://github.com/black-clov/risk_finance_Analyze_By_Python/blob/main/Risk%20Analysis%20of%20Tech%20Stocks.ipynb)
  * Here I used pandas Dataframe to represent adjusted closing prices and compute moving averages, daily returns, and associated risk of 'FAANG' tech companies.
  * Created visual representations of comparative daily returns and single-stock analysis using Matplotlib, as well as more complex heatmaps and distribution plots using Seaborn. 
  * Compared and plotted risk of investment between simple return analysis techniques and Monte-Carlo simulations.
